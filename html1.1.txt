1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

     In simple words HTTP1.1 can resuse the information whereas HTTP2 is concurrent which means it can do multitasking.


2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

var myCar = new Object();

myCar.make = 'Suzuki';

myCar.model = 'Altros';

myCar.year = 1978;

myCar.wheels = 2;

After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.

i.e.

myCar.year

Output: 1978

These values can be accessed using brackets notation also.

myCar[year]

Output: 1978

The syntax for adding a property to an object is :
ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;
The syntax for deleting a property from an object is:
delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;
The syntax to access a property from an object is:
objectName.property        
           //or
objectName["property”]     
           //or
objectName[expression]   
So, conclusion and simple definition for Java Script properties is “Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object”.


     Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal
     let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};


     Using the JavaScript Keyword new
var person = new Object();
person.firstName = “John”;
person.lastName = “Doe”;
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = “blue”;
